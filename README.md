## Synopsis

This project is intended to be an example solution of how you can create git hooks within the repository and leverage gradle to ensure that the git hooks are used to promote high code quality.

## Examples

Git hooks can help with mane things.  Some common ones are:
1. Run code through a formatter (or at least check it against a format)
2. Build the code before it committed / pushed (to prevent broken builds!)
3. Send alerts / updates about new commits

## Motivation

This project exists as a starting place to help teams leverage the power of git hooks.  Sure, you trust your teammates (or yourself, confidence is important!), but everyone makes silly mistakes! Catch them faster and save more time with git hooks!

## Installation

To use this project, clone or download the source, and use the snippet provided in the build.gradle to start applying git hooks in your repository today

## Contributors

Contributions, whether it is code snippets, additional git hook ideas, snippets, etc.

# Rules for Contributions

1. All code contributions must be properly documented with in-line comments. Explain what you have done as if it's brand new to the person you are showing it to.
2. Use the included formatter to format all code. // TODO: unimplemented, but will be soon
